## Style  

1. Adding a container
2. Improving the Animal Crossing theme (adding a proper background, recreating the holes Resetti used to appear in)  
3. Adding an animation for when Resetti spawn on the grid, he shows up as he were emerging from a hole
4. Adding an animation to highlight the damage Resetti takes
